# Adversarial_DA_Exp
This project is **heavliy** based on [MaxSquareLoss](https://github.com/ZJULearning/MaxSquareLoss) and [Adaptation Seg](https://github.com/YangZhang4065/AdaptationSeg). 
Most of the work is to reproduce the paper: Learning to adapt structured output space for semantic segmentation. We also change the segmentation model to DeeplabV3+ and compare their resutls.
